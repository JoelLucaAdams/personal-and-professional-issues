# Law

## General Law

## Criminal Law

- Represents society's view on what is acceptable behaviour
- Enforced by police
- **Crown Prosecution Service** (local society) brings people to court
- Punishment is severe, usually Jail, community service, fine, etc.

Examples:

- Theft
- Murder
- Fraud
- Unauthorised computer access
- Selling pirated software **knowingly**
- Sometimes health and safety failures

These cases are usually decided in the **Magistrates court** (95%) and happen on the day and more serious cases go to **Crown Court** (5%).

## Civil Law

- Less serious issues than Criminal Law
- Relationships between people
- No punishment or involvement of police or Crown Prosecution Service
- If claimant successful then court makes defendant pay compensation

Examples:

- Breach of Contract
- Tort (When you caused damages to someone else's property or individual)
- Defamation (publishing false information damaging to someone's reputation)
- Using pirated software
- Discrimination

## Standards of Proof

- To Convict someone of a **criminal offence**, the prosecution must prove *beyond reasonable doubt* that the defendant is guilty
- To obtain a judgement in a **civil case**, it is only necessary to establish the facts *on the balance of probabilities*

## Natural persons and legal persons

- **Individuals** are *natural persons*
- Companies and universities are not people and in order to make civil law applicable to them they must be **incorporated**, a legal process that gives them the status of *legal persons*

## How are laws made?

In England and Wales, the USA and most countries of the British Commonwealth there are two ways to make laws:

- By *act of parliament*. Known as the **Statute Law**
- By the *judgement of judges*. Known as the **Common Law**

**Case Laws** also exist where the law is based on **statute Law** but a judge deems it to be out of date similar to **Common Law**

## Common Law

- Works by precedent, basically judges based on how it has been handled in the past
- The decisions of courts in all countries are taken into account when handling issues
- A judge may decide times have changed and that a law is no longer appropriate

## European Union Law

- EU issues directives approved by **European Parliament** and the **Council of Ministers**
- Member states are required to enact legislation on the new directives
- **European Court of Justice** handles cases where interpretation or implementation of directives is in question

## Brexit

- UK legislation enacted in order to comply with EU directives will continue unless repealed by Parliament
- New EU directives may not be in UK legislation
- European Court of Justice no longer has jurisdiction over the UK

## Computer Misuse

- Gaining or attempting to gain unauthorised access to a computer or "hacking"
- Until 1990 wasn't an offence
- Occasional attempts to prosecute for "theft of electricity"

## Computer Misuse Act 1990

- Not very aware of the internet
- Did not coved **Denial of Service (DDoS)** Attacks but was amended by the **Police and Justice Act 2006**
- **Does not address computer laws** as existing laws on fraud dealt with this

The Act created 3 new offences:

- Unauthorised access ( the *basic offence*)
- Unauthorised access with intent to commit a serious crime
- Unauthorised modification of contents on a computer

## The *basic offence*

The person is guilty of an offence if:

- Causes a computer to perform any function with intent to secure access to any program or data held in any computer
- Access intended to be secured is unauthorised
- Knows at the time that doing this is against the law

Can't do it "by accident"

- Still liable if you have access to some programs/data on the system but try to get access to things that you are not authorised for
- Still liable if no damage has been done

Fines:

- Fine was £5000 or up to six months
- Changed later in the **Police and Justice Act 2006** to £5000 or up to *twelve months* in prison if tried in a **Magistrate's Court**
- Up to *two years* if tried in a **Crown Court**
- Can also be extraditable

## Police and Justice Act 2006

- Increased severity of penalties for the basic offence
- Introduced a new offence of *making, supplying or obtaining articles for use in computer misuse offences* (e.g. software kits)
- The unauthorised modification offence now covers *unauthorised acts with intent to impair, or with recklessness as to impairing* (e.g. DDoS)
- Penalties for unauthorised modification now up to *ten years and an unlimited fine* in a **Crown Court**

## Magistrates Courts

- Magistrates are local, respected community figures
- Magistrates Courts have *3 Magistrates* and a *Legal Advisor*
- More complex matters may involve a *District Judge*

There are three kids of cases:

- **Summary** offences (minor offences) are dealt here
- **Either-way** offences may go to **Crown Court**, it the defendant insists on their right to a jury trial or the magistrates decide that the case is too serious
- **Indictable-only** offences (murder, manslaughter, rape, robbery) must go to **Crown Court** directly

## Crown Court

- For more serious cases or **either-way** offences where the defendant has insisted on Crown Court trial
- Consists of *Judge* and *jury* (12 members of the public)
- Usually gives harsher sentences

## Some Case Examples

### LulzSec

- International hacking group that attacked many large websites
- Sony, Fox, News International, PBS, UK Serious Organised Crime Agency, CIA
- DDoS attacks/data extraction and dumping of personal data
- Four members were caught in London in 2013

### British Pregnancy Advice Service

- **James Jeffrey** hacking into the website and extracted 10,000 records of women whoo had pregnancies terminated
- Threatened to publish data on the web
- Sentenced to *32 months imprisonment in July 2012*

### Active Investigation Services

- Private detective agency set up by two serving police officers
- Hired in one instance by a waste disposal company to spy on Environmental Agency staff that were monitoring it's activities
- Many other police officers and three wealthy businessmen hired company expecting them to use illegal methods were also convicted

### Blackmail by threat of DDoS attack

- Two hackers attempted to blackmail Manchester online casino owner by threatening to close site using DDoS attack
- Sentenced to *5 years and 4 months imprisonment in 2013*

### Post-mortem on Emiliano Sala

- CCTV company watched post-mortem footage of famous footballer and posted a photo on twitter
- Director and employee got *14 months and 5 months respectively*
- Judged said that it had taken place in "a culture" where staff watched many post-mortem examinations even though they "had no justification to do so"

## Why Are Prosecutions so rare?

- Fear of bad publicity
- Cases are technically complex
- Police lack resources and expertise
- Time-consuming
- External experts are expensive
- Convictions are rare

## Computer Fraud

- Manipulating a computer dishonestly to obtain money, property or services to cause a loss
- Most techniques are much older than computers
- Most common frauds are *fictitious payroll employees, false supplier accounts and false invoices*
- **Fraud Act 2006** clarified the law hugely and fixed some technical problems

## Data Protection, Privacy and Freedom of Information

<hr>

## Part 1

## Data Protection

- Has political aspects
- Many people have access to data
- What data should be public and what should be public

## Historical Context

- started in 1970s
- Huge amounts of data are being moved from paper to centralised computer systems
- Must be kept safe
- Must only be used for it's original purpose
- Must be up to date and correct

Started with **Council of Europe Convention 108**:

- *"Convention for the protection of individuals with regard to automatic processing of personal data"*
- Signed by UK in 1981, ratified in 1987

**UK Data Protection Act 1984** protects individuals from:

- The use of inaccurate personal information or information that is incomplete or irrelevant
- The use of personal information byu unauthorised persons
- The use of personal information for purposes other than that for which it was collected

Examples of misuse:

- Refusing someone a mortgage because someone else lived there prior to them with a bad credit score
- Using credit card records to build up a profile of a person's movements over an extended period
- Taking pictures of sensitive data and sharing them online

## General Protection Act 2018 & General Data Protection Regulation

GDPR and DPA 2018 together extended the 1998 Act

- Data subjects must give much more explicit permission before their personal data can be used in ways other than that for which it was primarily collected
- A number of new offences are created and some existing ones criminalised

GDPR

- EU Law
- UK has committed to it indefinitely, Brexit makes no difference
- UK GDPR and EU GDPR are slightly different

## Information Commissioner's Office

- They are an *independent official*
- Currently Elizabeth Denham
- *"uphold information rights in the public interest, promoting openness by public bodies and data privacy for individuals"*
- Investigates breaches and issues fines

<hr>

## Part 2

- Decided which individuals to collect data about
- Appoints the data processors

## Terminology: Data Processor

Anyone who precesses personal data on behalf of the data controller and who is not an employee of the data controller. This might include an application service provider, such as a company that provides online hotel booking services

- Follow instructions from the data controller
- Given the data, or told what data to collect/process
- Do not themselves decide to collect/process data
- Not interested in the end results

## Terminology: Data Subject

The person who is the subject of personal data

## Terminology: Personal Data

- Their physical or mental **health**
- Their **sexual life**
- whether they have committed a **criminal offence**

Rules for processing **Sensitive Personal Data** are stricter than those of regular **Personal Data**

<hr>

## Part 3

## Data Protection Principles

### First Principle

"*Personal data shall be processed fairly and lawfully and in particular shall not be processed unless (a) at least one of the conditions in Schedule 2 is met and (b) in the case of sensitive personal data, at least one of the conditions in Schedule 3 is also met.*"

## Rights of Data Subjects

Back in 1984, subjects had...

- to **know** whether a data controller holds data relating to them
- to **see** the data, *and*
- to have the data **erased** or **corrected** if it is inaccurate

## Right to Privacy for Individuals

- European Convention on Human Rights says "*Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and correspondence*"
- ECHR not part of EU law, but enacted into UK law by Human Rights Act 1998
- Concern over surveillance (by security services and even employers) led to **Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIPA)**

## Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (2000)

- **Sets up a framework** for controlling the lawful interception of computer, telephone and postal communications
- **Allows government security services and law enforcement authorities to intercept, monitor and investigate** electronic data only in certain specified situations such as when preventing and detecting a crime
    - Powers include being able to **demand the disclosure of data encryption keys**
- Some concern that the range of public bodies with these rights are too high
- **Also provides the right for Communication Services Providers (CSPs) to monitor** but only under certain conditions...
    - **To establish facts**, for example, on what date was a specific order placed
    - **To ensure that the organisation's regulations** and procedures are being complied with
    - **To ascertain or demonstrate standards** which are or ought to be achieved
    - **To Prevent or detect crime**
    - **To investigate or detect unauthorised use** of telecommunication systems

## Investigatory Powers Act 2016

- Creates **Investigatory Powers Commission**
- **Requires CSPs** to main users' **internet connection records** and to assist with targeted interception
    - **Which websites were visited** but not the particular pages and not the full browsing history (for one year)
    - Allows **police, intelligence officers** and department managers from **many other government bodies** to see internet connection records, as part of a targeted and filtered investigation, without a warrant
- Provides **legal protection** for **privileged communications**

## Freedom of Information Act 2000

- creates a **general right of access to information held by public bodies**
- imposes a **duty on public authorities to adopt a scheme for the publication of information**.The schemes specify the classes of information the authority intends to publish and the manner of publication
- there are **many exemptions**, some of which include a **public interest test**
- created a new office of **Information Commissioner** and a new **Information Rights Tribunal** with wide powers to enforce the rights. This was done by extending the powers of the Data Protection Registrar and the Data Protection Tribunal.

<hr>

## Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)

Legally theft involves **taking a piece of someone's property with the intention permanently to deprive them of it**

## Tangible vs Intangible Property

- Anything you can touch is **tangible property**. These are covered by laws such as **theft** and **damage**
- Anything else is **intangible property** and is typically **intellectual property**
- It might be in the form of something you can touch (e.g. USB, piece of paper with formula)
- Governed by a different set of laws

## International

- Intellectual property crosses borders much more easily than tangible property
- Internation IP law goes back to the Paris Convention of 1883 and the Berne Convention of 1886

## Types of rights

- **Copyright** - the right to copy something
- **Patents** - protection of inventions
- **Confidential information**
- **Trade marks** - product identification

<hr>

## Copyright

- Protects the following ...
    - Original literacy, dramatic, musical and artistic works (including photos)
    - Sound recordings, films and cable transmissions
    - The typographical arrangements of published editions
- Protected things are called **works**

### Software

The Copyright, Patent and Designs Act 1988 states that the phrase 'literacy work' includes a **table** or **compilation**, a **computer program and preparatory design material for a computer program**

## Who Owns Copyright?

- The **author** owns the copyright unless...
    - The **author is an employee** and the work is an **original work created in the course of their employment**
    - In which case the copyright belongs to the **employer**
- **independent contractors** are not employees and so **will own copyright unless it is agreed otherwise**
- Copyright can only be **transferred in writing**
- Copyright does **not need to be registered**

## What are the rights of copyright?

No-one can do these things without the copyright owner's permission:

- **Copy** the work (includes copying from disk to RAM to run it, or to download a webpage into your browser memory)
- **Issue copies** to the public
- **Make an adaptation** of the work (e.g. re-writing a program from C++ in Java)
- **Rent or lend copies** to the public
- **Perform, play or show** the work to the public
- **Broadcast** the work or transmit on a cable service

## Identical material

- **Copyright law does not prevent someone else using or publishing identical material**
- Provided they can show they didn't copy someone else's copyright work
- Programmers often produce identical code
- **This is very different from patent law**

## Duration of Copyright

- EU and UK - **70 years from the death of the author** for literacy, artistic or software even if the author has transferred copyright to another person
    - Films: **70 years** after the death of the last director, author or composer
    - Sound recordings: **50 years** from the making of the work
    - Typography: **25 years** from publication
- USA - **70 years** for works published after 2002, but can be **95 years** after the date of the publication for earlier works
- Canada - **50 years** after the death of the author

## Database Rights

- If a database is the **authors** then regular copyright applies
- If there has been "*substantial investment in obtaining, verifying or presenting the contents of the database*", then it is protected by the database right
- This lasts for **15 years**, but resets every time the database is updated

## Copyright Infringement

- Anyone who, without consent, does any of the things that are the exclusive right of the owner then they have committed **primary infringement** of copyright.
- **Secondary infringement** occurs when an infringement is performed knowingly and in the course of business
- Primary infringement is purely a civil matter (**you can be sued**)
- Secondary infringement can be a criminal offence (**you can be tried and lead to imprisonment**)

## What Can be Done Under Copyright

- Fair dealing (fair use) - copying of
    - Private study or research
    - Criticism or review
    - Reporting current events
- Making backup copies
- Selling on
- Decompilation of interoperability
- Error correction

## "selling software"

- Software isn't bought very often
- Usually licensed out but still belongs to the publisher
- user is a **licensee** and have some rights but significantly less rights that the owner

<hr>

## Confidential Information

- Information can't be stolen
- Can prevent information being disclosed or used provided a **obligation of confidence** exists

## Obligations of Confidence

- Through a contract such as an employment contract or **Non-Disclosure Agreement**
- **There doesn't need to be an explicit clause in the contract** for it to exist

These obligations are used...

- To **prevent sales staff taking sales leads** with them when they leave
- Between **companies that wish to collaborate** through a Non-Disclosure Agreement
- To **prevent employees who leave from taking technical secrets** to other companies
- To **prevent technical information being used by competitors** through **Licence Agreements**

<hr>

## Patents

- Give inventor the exclusive right to use or exploit their invention for up to 20 years
- Much stronger that copyright
- Cannot be exploited by another **even if they discovered it themselves**
- All patents are **published and publicly available**
    - Mainly published for **patent searches**

## Publishing

**All patents are published and publicly available** where the main idea is to encourage invention by providing a time-limited monopoly.

One way of exploiting a patent is through **licensing**

## What Qualifies for a Patent?

- Must be **new**
- Must involve and **"inventive" step**
    - Patent cannot be obvious
    - not be something that anyone reasonably competent in the field would have produced if faced with the same requirements
- Must be capable of **industrial application**
- Must not be **specifically excluded**

## Exclusions

European Patent Convention and Copyright Design and Patents Act 1988 excludes:

- **scientific theories** - can patent a system that uses gravity to it's advantage but can't patent gravity itself
- **Mathematical methods** - can patent a machine to calculate things quickly but can't patent a new maths technique
- **Literary, artistic, musical, dramatic creations** - these are already protected by copyright
- **The presentation of information** - covered by copyright
- A **scheme, rule or method for performing a mental act** - e.g. a computer program

## Getting a Patent

- Must establish **priority** to make sure you are the first to patent
- Good idea to get a **patent in all major markets**
- Complicated and time consuming process that can take **years**
- Will need to hire **professional help** and therefore **expensive**
- System favours larger companies

## Software Patents (EU)

- The **European Patent Convention** states that **software is not patentable**
- The patent office has **still been granting patents for software since 1980**
- Not enforced across Europe as owners fear that they will be declared invalid

## Software Patents (US)

- The patent office **grants patents freely to software** and US courts enforce them in some cases
- **Particular problems** are caused by patents on **compression techniques, audio and video processing, and cryptography**
- **US courts have thrown out** many attempts to enforce software patents that obviously should have not been granted but they **have enforced more sensible ones**

## Thoughts on Patents

- Unfair that something is patentable if it's in hardware but not in software
- Software industry's success is driven by small companies
- Patents are expensive to register and enforce for small companies
- Many software patents are worthless
    - No inventive step
    - Much "prior art" which is hard to find
    - patent litigation can still happen and is expensive for small companies

<hr>

## Trademarks

Includes the following...

- **Logos**
- **Trade names** (e.g. Apple, Microsoft, Windows)
- **Distinctive costume** (e.g. the outfit of airline cabin crew)
- **"Get-up" or "trade dress"** (e.g. what makes a product look unique)

"*A trademark is a sign capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one enterprise from those of another enterprise*"

## Registering Trademarks

- Can be registered®
- Can be unregistered™
- It is an offence to use a registered trade mark you do not own or do not have permission to use
- Usually a criminal offence with up to **2 years** in prison
- Trade mark owners can also sue for **financial damage**

## Unregistered Trademarks

- Easier to defend a registered trade mark
- However unregistered ones can be defended with "passing-off" laws (making consumers think the product is associated with someone else by using their trademark)

## Trademarks and software

- Display logo prominently using a splash screen
- If anyone sells pirated copies of the game then the splash screen will be displayed
- Leads to a breach of the Trade Marks Act 1994
