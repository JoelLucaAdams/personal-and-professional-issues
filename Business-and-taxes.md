There are **three** different types of organisations

    - **In law**: Run the business by yourself and don't do anything else
- Business Partnership
    - Two or more people carrying on a business
    - **In law**: Run a business in partnership with other people and don't do anything else
- Limited Liability Partnership (or Company)
    - Introduced in **2000** and is much more flexible
    - **In law**: A legal construct meant for business

## Sole Trader

- Ownership is divided into shares that can be bought and sold

## Business names (Applies to all organisations)

- **In law**: a set of rules on naming your business
- Can not:
    - Be offensive
    - Be the same as an existing trade-mark or company (e.g. if Apple doesn't register it's trade mark in the UK and another company has that name then it can use it)
    - Suggest a connection with government or authority
- If it is a **partnership** or **sole trader**
    - name must not suggest that you are a company
- If business is a company
    - Must include the appropriate abbreviation (Ltd, PLC)
    - If an LLP the name must also include LLP

## Business Plans

To ensure that:

- You and other people involved have a clear agreement and view of **what the business is going to do**
- You (as a company) have a clear vision of **how it will develop**
- There is a **plausible scenario** under which your business will develop
- A typical business plan covers 2-4 years
- Needs to be reviewed and revised **every year**
- As a company matures this plan morphs into a **strategic plan**
- This is not a prediction of what will happen but a *demonstration that there is a plausible scenario which it will be successful*

## Checklist for a Business Plan

- Usually **limited in value**
- Very useful in short-term

## Loans/Overdrafts

- Available from banks but not often offered to start-ups
- No security required
- Very flexible
- Interest rate is variable but you only pay interest on what is owed

However:

- Banks can withdraw the loan at short notice and possibly bankrupt the business
- Only really suitable for short-term borrowing

## Commercial Loans

- Normally fixed-term, fixed-interest
- Interest payable from start date

## These models

- Hope that companies they invest in are successful enough to be floated on a stock exchange
- They can then sell their shares for a substantial profit
- Expect to make a loss on 80% of their investment but a very large profit on the other 20%

## Crowdfunding

## Sales and Marketing

"*Build it and they will come*" only works in movies. "*Marketing is build it, nurture it, engage the customer, and they will come and stay*"

## Sales vs Marketing

- **Selling** - persuading a specific customer to buy a specific product
- **Marketing**
    - Creating an environment in which customers will consider buying what you have to offer
    - Advertising is a *marketing* activity
    - Product planning is also a key part

An example of this would be...

- Case - selling a car
- Marketing - advert on Facebook/Ebay
- Selling - Convincing people who contact you to buy

## B2B vs B2C

**Business to Business** (B2B) where the customer is another company or organisation

**Business to Customer** (B2C) where the customer is a private individual

Examples of B2B

- Customers outside of the IT industry
    - Package for use in veterinary practices
    - Payroll systems
    - Air Traffic Control system
- Customers of the IT industry
    - System for version control and configuration management
    - Database Management System
    - Games development toolkit

## Marketing

- Web presence/SEO
- Conferences, talks, trade-stands, demonstrations, etc.
- Articles and reviews in the trade press
- Product Launches
    - Webinars
    - User groups
- Brochures

## Sales

- Trial period
- Reference sites
- Well-designed website
- High quality support
    - Documentation
    - Product training
    - Backward compatibility

## Marketing Mix

- Create a website - Describes the companies services
- Identify potential customers

## Selling to Large Organisations

Be approved as a contractor

- Also be considered for other work

## Responding to ITTs

Some things need to be considered

- Public sector: ITTs may be for contracts worth up to £100 million
- Submitting a realistic tender may require several years of work
- Make sure you are capable of doing the job
- Do we have a realistic change of winning the contract?
- Can we afford the risk?
Do we need a consortium?

## Annual Financial Statements

Definition - *Formal records of financial activities and position of a business, person, or other entity*

Examples are:

- Monthly bank statement
- Mobile phone statement
- Electricity usage statement

These can be complex for large organisations

Required **annually** for business

## Annual Financial Statements (AFS)

- **In law** - required in order to show:
    - **Financial state** of the company
    - **Predicted financial statements** for first 2/3 years
- **Expected** in serious business plans

Consists of three main parts

- **Balance Sheet** - Snapshot of the financial state of the company at a given point in time
- **Profit and Loss Account (P&L)** - Income and expenditure of the company over a period (typically 12 months)
- **Cash-Flow statement** - Flow of cash into and out of the company for the same period as the P&L (**not required for small companies**)

## Balance Sheet

- Assets
    - Current assets - temporary
    - Fixed assets
- Liabilities
    - Current liabilities - paid in the current accounting period
    - long term liabilities - paid in future accounting periods
- Equity
    - Companies worth (see later on in document)

Assets = Liabilities + Equity (**The Accounting Equation**)

## Current Assets (CA)

- Cash
- Items **expected to be turned into cash** over the next year
    - **Debts owed** to the company
    - **WIP**/stocks of items intended for sale
- Value on balance sheets - either cost price or net realisable value (whichever is lower)

## Fixed Assets (FA)

- Contribute to the company's productive capacity (e.g. work stations, office furniture, company vehicles)
- Not bought and sold as part of company's day-to-day business
- There are two different types:
    - **Tangible fixed assets** - have a physical existence (e.g. computers)
    - **Intangible fixed assets** - have no physical existence (e.g. IPR)

## Purchasing and Valuing Fixed Assets

- FA expected to contribute to company's productive capacity for a number of years
- Therefore sensible to spread the associated cost over those years
- Process is known as **deprecation**

## Equity

- What is the companies worth
- **Called-up share capital**
    - Nominal value of all issued shares
- **Share Premium account**
    - Extra funds obtained by selling newly issued shares at a premium
- **Profit and Loss account**
    - Accumulated profit (or loss) since company was founded
- **Shareholders Equity**
    - Total of the above
