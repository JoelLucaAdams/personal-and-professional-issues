# Management/Engineering

## Professional Issues in the Computing Industry

## Sustainability

1. (economics) the ability to be sustained, without causing problems
2. (ecology) (of economic development, energy sources) the ability to be maintained at a steady level without exhausting natural resources or causing severe ecological damage

### Economic Sustainability

- Computers and associated equipment cost money to buy and run and are to free to install in business
- All money spent running equipment must be earned by the company to produce a profit
- Computing equipment needs to be useful enough to increase profits in company
- Servers:
    - Electricity to power the server
    - Electricity for the networking equipment
    - Electricity to run the cooling systems (roughly ~1 Watt for every Watt supplied)

### Environmental Sustainability

- Most power sources come with a CO2 cost
- 50% of energy use for a computer is used during manufacturing
- Most servers run very low loads so power is greatly wasted
- Electricity transmission is inefficient (2-10% loss)

Computing can be made more sustainable by using:

- VMs
- Cloud (however security issues)
- Load balancing (10-50% normally)
- Consider server location
    - Should it be stored in data center or locally?
    - It is easier to transmit data rather than energy
    - Renewable energy available in location
    - Consider energy tariffs
- Using computing energy in one place to save energy elsewhere
    - Video conferencing
    - Smart cities
    - More efficient aviation routes
    - Using IoT to measure and alter appliances in the house

## Microcontrollers

- Engine management systems
    - Save fuel by providing cleaner engines
    - More accurate readings to drivers
- Smart meters
- 'Intelligent' air cooling
- 'Intelligent' radiator thermostat
- Environmental monitoring
- Climate modelling
- Environment modelling
- Computational medical drug analysis

## Human Resources

- Recruitment + promotion
- Contracts
- Dismissal + redundancy
- Staff Training
- Salaries
- Compliance with legislation
- Health and safety
- Prevention of discrimination

HR can be very time consuming. It can take up a significant portion of work in a company and usually requires a dedicated person.

## Legal Framework

- The Employment Act (1996)
- Equalities Act (2010)
- Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Bill (2013)
- European Union (withdrawal) Act 2018

All of these need to be applied within the boundaries of case law

## Salaries

- Always a legal matter
    - Equality legislation
    - Job equivalence
    - Higher Education Job Analysis (HERA)
- A staff satisfaction matter
- A staff retention matter

## CPD

Is there any Continued Professional Development in the company and is it included in the contract. Do you get extra training and is it structured into your job.

## Recruitment and Interviews

- HR will be actively involved in every job advert and the recruitment procedure
- Dealing with paperwork
- Sitting in on interviews
- Legal compliance

## Dismissal and Redundancy

### Dismissal

- Fair
    - Lack of capability to complete a job
    - Misconduct
    - Breach of the law or contract
    - Redundancy
- Unfair
    - Employer didn't provide adequate training
    - Employer didn't issue warnings
    - Employ didn't follow contractual procedures
    - Employer didn't follow legal procedures
- Constructive
    - Change of job location
    - Change of duties
    - Countermanding instructions

### Redundancy

- You are no longer needed in the company and you are no longer generating valuable revenue
- Your skills may no longer fit the company

## Discrimination

Equalities Act (2010) defines protected characteristics:

- Age
- Disability
- Gender Reassignment
- Race, Colour, Ethnic Origin, Nationality
- Sexual Orientation
- Marriage
- Civil Partnership
- Pregnancy/Maternity
- Religion
- Sex

## Structure of Organisations

There are 3 main organisational models:

- Bureaucratic - fixed set of rules to follow and everyone specialises
- Organic - Everyone speaks to everyone and low specialisation, much more versatile
- Matrix - multiple managers, people move around easily

## Bureaucratic Model

1. All tasks are spilt into specialised jobs, in which job holders become experts and therefore making them responsible for their performance.
2. Performance of each task is governed by precise rules. Helps to bring consistency to tasks and coordination with other tasks.
3. Each person is accountable to exactly one manager
4. Employees need to refer to co-workers and clients in an impersonal and formal manner
5. Recruitment is based on qualifications and employees are **protected against arbitrary dismissal**. Promotion is based on **seniority and achievement**. Lifetime employment is envisaged.

## Organic Model

- Organisations structure is categorized by:
    1. flatness: communications and interactions are horizontal so people can talk to bosses easily
    2. Low specialisation: knowledge resides wherever it is and most useful
    3. Decentralization: great deal of formal and informal participation in decision making
- More complex and harder to form
- Highly adaptable
- Flexible
- More suitable where external environment is rapidly changing

## Matrix Management

- Individuals may report to multiple managers
- Common in environments where an expert provides the same knowledge to several ongoing projects
- Require sensible conflict solving

## Structuring principles

There are many different ways of structuring a company.

### Structure by Function

- Core business
- Administration
    - Finance
    - HR
    - Cleaning
- Sales and marketing
- Research and development

### Structure by Geography

- Multinational companies need a 'legal entity' in each country or region
- Assets Under Management (AUM) is the total market value of the investments that a company makes

### Structure by Product Line

- The company structure os split into sections (e.g. cars, replacement parts, etc.)
- Applicable to software companies who provide
    - Development
    - Maintenance of legal instillations
    - Consultancy and training

### Structure by Market Sector

- Good for sales and technical staff as they are closer to customer issues
- Risk of 'silos' or knowledge rather than sharing of expertise
- Danger of becoming trapped in stagnating markets

### Structure by Technology

- Groups
    - AI
    - Comms
    - Web systems
    - DB
- Obvious, but not very practical
    - A project will require multiple technologies
    - Expertise will often cross technologies
    - Very difficult to identify potential clients

## Depth of a company structure

Is it better to have a company that is **flat** (e.g. employees can talk directly to CEO) or **deep** (e.g. multiple levels like a binary tree).

- Flatter structures are more responsive
- Limit to 6 people reporting to a manager
- depths can very across sectors

## Centralised vs Decentralised

### Centralised

- Expert knowledge of technologies
- Easy to swap people into teams
- Added complexity from using inappropriate software
- Limited IDEs to support
- Maintenance is easier

### Decentralised

- Flexible
- Better matching of project needs
- Many different IDEs, Test tools, language versions to maintain
- Legacy issues with maintenance

## Job satisfaction

- Improving the 'bus number' for your company (the number of people that can be fired before your company fails)
- Job rotation (assign people different parts of the project at different times)
- Job enlargement (allow individuals to take on multiple tasks)
- Job enrichment (more responsibility, discretion and control)

## 360 management

- Consider how a change might affect the people of the company
- The people in other departments
- How does it benefit the company

## Procurement of goods

- Sometimes you need to buy goods for the company to run including software licences
- Factors to consider
    - Price
    - Function
    - Environment issues
    - Qualifications (safety, professional)
    - Delivery time
    - Procuring bespoke software is very different to procuring hardware

<hr>

## Security

Security is about keeping data hidden for those who shouldn't have access to it but be available to those that should. There are three main principles to follow:

- Preventing unauthorised copies
- Preventing unauthorised destruction
- Preventing unauthorised modification

**Never loose a customers' data** as it usually leaves to bankruptcy. "*80% of businesses affected by a major incident either never re-open or close within 18 months*" - Axa (Urban myth?)

## Electronic Security

- Firewalls
- OS permission profiles
    - For users and software
- System administration
    - Limiting running services
    - Patching software
- Code validation

There are three main points of attack:

- External attack
- Internal malice
    - Disgruntled employee
    - Blackmailed employee
    - ex employee
- Social engineering
    - Pen drives

## Physical Security

- Fire risk/hazard
- Theft of equipment
- Destruction of equipment

## Controlling Physical Access

Server rooms are usually the main point of attack

- Need restricted access
- Locked at all times
- Access logging
- Defined rules for authorised personnel
- Extinguisher systems

## Backup

- Backups should be done often
- Backups need to be off-site
- Make sure the data can be backed up
- What to backup data to?
- Available options
    - Mirrored servers
    - ZFS
    - File systems

## Security of Service

- Sever failure
- Network equipment failure
    - Backup servers
- Power failure
    - UPS
- Builders
    - The pen is mightier than the sword, but the JCB bucket is mightier than the fibre optic cable
- Hackers
    - Server hijack
    - DDOS
- Failover locations

## Service types

- How does the type of service that a machine provides affect the way you provide security?
- File server vs DB server vs web server vs ...
    - Target audience
    - Internal or external
    - Network effects
    - Dynamic nature of data
